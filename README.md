<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
# React Vite App

This is a modern web application built with React and powered by Vite as a part of learning React, a fast build tool and development server. The application demonstrates best practices in React development, including component-based architecture, state management, and efficient asset handling. With Vite, the development experience is enhanced by faster builds and hot module replacement, making it easier to iterate and develop new features rapidly.
